# actsync — state as of <YYYY-MM-DD>

The verified, current state of this project. Every session reads this file
first and updates it after any act that changes the state (a send, a merge,
a release, a decision, a reply received). Put the date of the update in the
title. Each fact names its source (file, commit, message) so it can be
re-checked; anything not yet verified is marked "unverified". No secrets,
tokens or personal identifiers here.

## Deadlines

| Date | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| <YYYY-MM-DD> | <deliverable or deadline> | <done / pending — what is missing> |

## Waiting on

- <who> — <what was asked, when, through what> — <follow-up date>

## Current state

<per area: what exists, what is decided, what is in progress — with the
source of each fact>

## Decisions

- <YYYY-MM-DD> — <decision taken by the owner> — <why, if given>

## Derived state

<commands that recompute state from the repository instead of re-reading
it, e.g. `scripts/status.py` — prefer a script whose output is a pure
function of tracked files>
